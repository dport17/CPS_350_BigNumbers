# CPS_350_BigNumbers
This is the README file for our project.
This project was completed by Paul Scheeler, Sydney Jenkins, Brandon Wong, and Devin Porter. 

Also, for those working on this: Don't be afraid to create a BRANCH of one of these files and work on it separate from the master branch, if you want. I'm not sure how much that really helps us right now, since we're pretty much just going to edit these until they work, but it's an option if you think you have a use for it or want to make sure that something will still work if you change it.
